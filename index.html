					<li>Context</li>
					<p>
						Since 19 July 1970, France is at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Prussian_War">war against Prussia</a>. Many rural residents were illiterate
						and
						depended
						upon news of the war from educated, often noble residents, which they resented. On 16 August, during a fair at Hautefaye, Camille de Maillard de Lafaye, son
						of
						the mayor of
						the
						nearby town
						of Beaussac and cousin of Alain de Monéys reports the war was not going well. Many villagers had been drinking and received the news poorly, accusing him of
						peddling
						false news and beholden to the Prussians.<br>
						The crowd eventually accused him of yelling « Vive la République ! » ("Long live the Republic!") and began to be more and more hostile. Frightened, Camille
						and
						his
						party fled.
					</p>
					<p>
						Alain de Monéys arrives at the Hautefaye's fair around 2 PM, after Camille de Maillard left, and faces approching peasants armed with sticks. Inquiring
						about
						the
						situation he is beeing told by a peddler named Brethenoux that his cousin yelled « À bas Napoléon ! Vive la République ! » ("Down with Napoléon! Long live
						the
						Republic!").
						Refusing to believe it, Monéys accompanies him to the scene of the incident to check wether other witnesses confirm the facts. Among them are: Le Cussou,
						Pinard, Mazière, the Campot brothers and Buisson, whom, all confirm Brethenoux sayings. The group gather around Alain de Monéys whom keeps defending his
						cousin.
					</p>
					<li>Beating</li>
					<p>
						Still refusing to admit that Camille de Maillard might pronounce such words, Monéys is then targeted by the group, bigger and bigger and more hostile. Some
						confusing him with Maillard, he becomes the center of interst and is then also accused of saying « Vive la République ! », of being a traitor and a
						Prussian.
						Despite his protests (he assures being on the side of the peasants and that he is joining the fight against Prussians soon), the group utter the first death
						threats and take the first blows.
					</p>
					<p>
						Buisson yells: « C'est un Prussien, il faut le pendre, il faut le brûler ! » ("He is a Prussian, he must be hanged, he must be burnt!"). The Campot brothers
						take
						the first blows, leading to the collective aggression. Trying to protect himself from bows, yelling « Vive l'empereur ! » ("Long live the emperor"), Alain
						de
						Monéys is rescued by Abbé Saint-Pasteur, parish priest of Hautefaye. Abbé Saint-Pasteur intervene, a gun in the hand, but feeling himself exposed to the
						anger
						of the group, he takes refuge in the presbytery. He attempted a diversion by offering the peasants to accompany him to drink to the health of the emperor,
						which
						some of them agreed to do.
					</p>
					<p>
						Then intervene Philippe Dubois and Georges Mathieu, the nephew of the mayor of the village, who try to withdraw Monéys from the repeated assaults of the
						peasants; Monéys is already reached by the blows of hoofs, sticks and stings. They want him to enter the house of the mayor, Bernard Mathieu, but the latter
						forbids entry for fear that the madmen will break in and break his dishes. The protectors, again, can no longer contain the group. Mazière
						and Buisson then seize the victim and deliver him again to the fury of the peasants satisfied with the wine offered by the priest.
					</p>
					<li>Attempted hanging</li>
					<p>
						Lead by Chambord, the group initially plans to bring Monéys to the authorities, but, faced with the passivity of the village mayor, the peasants decide to
						hang
						him from a cherry tree. the lack of authority of the mayor at this moment allows Chambord to become the head of the punitive enterprise: he goes so far as
						to
						claim to be a member of the Hautefaye municipal council, which allows him to take initiatives. The hanging attempt fails, because of the fragility of the
						branches of the tree; it was decided to beat him to death.
					</p>
					<li>Tortures</li>
					<p>
						From then on, the intention to make the torture last before the killing of Alain de Monéys is effective. Chambord harangues the group: « Avant de faire
						périr
						le Prussien, il faut le faire souffrir » ("Before destroying the
						Prussian, he must be made to suffer"). The torturers provide moments of rest to the victim before returning to the charge. He is dragged into the room which
						serves as a workshop for the mayor, who is also a farrier. The attackers tied him tightly with straps to the work to be shoeed, while he was violently
						beaten in the face and legs with a hoof and a stick by Bouillet known as « Déjeunat ». Going to the fair to join his master, Pascal, the servant of the
						Monéys, alerted by cries and warned by Georges Mathieu and Dubois, rushes to deliver Alain de Monéys from the workshop, taking advantage of the temporary
						absence of the attackers. The group's return, however, caused the new rescue attempt to fail. Once again beaten, Monéys was hit in the head by a very
						violent blow which Piarrouty struck him with his hook scale, and which some witnesses believed to be fatal.</p>
					<p>
						At the insistence of the victim's protectors, the mayor proposes to bring him into his sheep barn. Alain de Monéys is sheltered and cared for by Dubois. At
						this moment he believed himself saved and wanted to buy a barrel of wine for his pursuers. But external pressure from the group led by Chambord ends up
						getting the better of the door, at the moment Monéys tries to exchange his clothes for a blouse in an attempt to flee by going
						unnoticed on Dubois's advice.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Campot brothers seize the victim and deliver her to the peasants, whose violence reaches its climax. The head of Alain de Monéys is "like a globe of
						blood". Dubois tries to get him into the inn but the innkeeper closes the door on Monéys' ankle as he begins to enter and Monéys collapses in pain. He is
						considered dead but unexpectedly get up, walk towards a barn, picks a stake and point it at the group of madmen. Jean Campot easily disarms Monéys and turns
						the stake against him while he is dragging himself under a cart. As soon as Monéys is extirpated, Pierre Buisson strucks him with the stake in the neck.
						From this moment, it is on a dying man, even a corpse, that the crowd is bent on, each wanting to participate in the quarry which lasts
						about ten minutes. After the beatings on the body, Mazière and Jean Campot each take a leg of the victim with the intention of quartering it, but they only
						succeed in removing his shoes.
					</p>
					<li>Cremation</li>
					<p>Mazière and Campot drag him in the direction of an old pond, which the inhabitants call “the dry lake” and where it is customary to celebrate Saint-Jean.
						They are followed by the procession formed by the peasants and the mayor wearing his scarf. Arrived on the scene, they throw the body in the dry pond. Under
						the direction of Chambord, they look for fagots, branches, and debris. Chambord takes a bale of straw from a farmer, while promising him reimbursement by
						the emperor. Piled up on the body, whichis still moving, the bundles and hay are packed by Chambord and Campot. In a final
						attempt, Dubois tries to prevent the irreparable from happening, but he is chased by a dozen peasants and is forced to move away.</p>
					<p>
						No one having matches, Chambord goes to find, or has young Thibassou look for a packet of matches, and asks three children to set fire to the pile of
						fagots and hay. The pyre is set ablaze to the cheers of the audience, shouting « Vive l'empereur29 ! » ("Long live the Emperor!") A man named Duroulet
						comments on the immolation with
						these words: « Voyez comment cela grille bien ! » ("See how well it grills!") A man named Besse adds, seeing the fat draining from the body in the process
						of being consumed: « Dommage que toute cette graisse soit perdue » (“Too bad that all
						this fat is lost”), another lights his cigarette on the embers of the stake.</p>
					<li>Aftermath</li>
					<p>The evening of the tragedy, the inhabitants of the surroundings are already aware of the events of Hautefaye. Some protagonists boast of their actions,
						Piarrouty speaks of the three blows of the scales he struck the victim. Pierre Sarlat and the stonemason François Cholet believe that they will be paid by
						the emperor for having burned Monéys.</p>
					<p>
						The charred body of Alain de Monéys is placed between two sheets in the church of Hautefaye. Doctor Roby-Pavillon, who carried out the autopsy, writes, on
						the evening of August 16, the report describing the state of the remains: “Corpse almost entirely charred and lying on its back, its face turned a little
						towards the sky, to the left, the lower limbs spread apart, the right hand stiffened above the head, as if to implore, the left hand brought back towards
						the corresponding shoulder and spread out, as if to ask for mercy; the facial features expressing pain, the trunk twisted and pulled back”. From the
						examination of the body, the doctor establishes that he was burned during his lifetime and that he died of asphyxiation and burns, and that previously he
						was injured by blunt, prickly and sharp. The skull wound was carried by an individual stationed behind Monéys, while the latter was standing, and he was
						dragged alive. Roby-Pavillon concludes that “all of these injuries would inevitably have resulted in death”.
					</p>
					<p>
						Nontron's gendarmes, dispatched to the scene and to the neighborhood, made the first arrests. About fifty people were arrested and questioned by Judge
						Marchenaud. On August 19, Charles Boreau-Lajanadie, Attorney General of the Imperial Court of Bordeaux, went to the scene of the murder and took charge
						of the investigation of the case.
					</p>
					<p>Twenty-one people are charged with:
					<ol class="charged">
						<li>Beauvais, dit Roumaillac, pitsawyer in Vieux-Mareuil;</li>
						<li>Besse dit Duroulet, digger in Javerlhac;</li>
						<li>Brouillet dit Déjeunat, owner in Grézilles, commune of Feuillade (Charente);</li>

						<li>Sallat fils, farmer in Grand-Gilou, commune of Hautefaye;</li>
						<li>Sarlat, known as Lamy, tailor of clothes in Nontronneau, commune of Lussas.</li>
					</ol>
					</p>
					<p>The twenty-one accused appeared at the Périgueux court on December 13.</p>
					<li>Convictions</li>
					<p>
						On December 21, after deliberation by the jury, the court sentences Chambord, Buisson, Piarrouty and Mazière to the death penalty. Justice orders that the
						execution take place in the public square of Hautefaye. Jean Campot benefited from a jury error (mitigating circumstances were acquired by six votes instead
						of the required seven), and was sentenced to life imprisonment in the penal colony of New Caledonia. The other defendants are sentenced, for the heaviest
						sentences to eight years of forced labor, and for the lightest to one year in prison. One of the accused, Thibaud Limay dit Thibassou, is acquitted but,
						because of his young age, sent to a house of correction until he is twenty. On December 25, a few days after the end of the trial, the former mayor of
						Hautefaye, Bernard Mathieu - probably seized with remorse - died in Charente.
					</p>
					<p>
						On January 26, 1871, the appeal in cassation of the four condemned to death was rejected, as well as the request for pardon which arrived on January 30 at
						the Ministry of Justice.

						The guillotine was to be initially installed instead of the old drained pond where the immolation of Alain de Monéys had taken place, but, the ground being
						too hilly, the scaffold was erected on the morning of February 6 in the hall of cattle. As the executioner Jean-François Heidenreich was unable to travel,
						it was his first aide Nicolas Roch who carried out the execution. The four condemned are beheaded in the following order: Piarrouty first, then Buisson,
						Mazière, and finally Chambord.
